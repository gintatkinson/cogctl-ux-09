# Use Case: Use Case 3: Validate Expiry & Temporal State (Issue #14)

## OOA/OOD Realization
- **Primary Actor:** Location Registry Daemon
- **Preconditions:** Location records exist with timestamp and valid-until fields configured.
- **Success Guarantee (Postconditions):** Expired entries are flagged or removed, and valid entries remain active.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The Actor scans the database for entries with `valid-until` timestamps.
2. The System compares the current server time to the `valid-until` timestamp of each entry.
3. The System identifies entries where the current time is greater than `valid-until`.
4. The System marks those entries as "Expired" and updates their status.

## Extensions
- **2a. Missing valid-until field:**
  - The entry does not have a `valid-until` time configured.
  - The System treats the entry as permanently valid and skips expiration marking.
