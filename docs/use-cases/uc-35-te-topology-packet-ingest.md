# Use Case 35: Ingest and Validate Packet Traffic Engineering Topologies (Issue #203)

## 1. Actors
- **Primary Actor**: SDN Controller
- **Secondary Actors**: Network Configuration Engine, Topology DB

## 2. Preconditions
- The network supports Packet TE topologies (RFC 8795).
- The network management agent is operational and configured with the `ietf-te-topology-packet` schema.

## 3. Trigger
- The Network Configuration Engine pushes a new topology update or interface capability modification.

## 4. Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)
1. The SDN Controller receives a topology update containing interface switching capabilities.
2. The SDN Controller identifies the topology type as `packet` (PSC).
3. The SDN Controller validates the minimum LSP bandwidth and interface MTU attributes.
4. The configurations are stored in the Topology DB and marked as operational.

## 5. Alternate and Exception Flows
- **5a. Missing Packet Topology Type**:
  - 1. The controller detects that the topology lacks the `packet` presence container augment.
  - 2. The controller rejects the PSC interface capability configuration since it is valid only in packet TE topologies.
  - 3. The flow terminates.

## 6. Postconditions (Guarantees)
- **Success Guarantee**: The packet TE topology attributes are verified and successfully stored in the Topology DB.
- **Failure Guarantee**: Invalid topology configurations are rejected, maintaining database integrity.

## 7. Operational Context
> Processing packet-specific topology attributes ensures that the SDN controller computes valid paths based on real switching capabilities.

## 8. Realization Matrix
