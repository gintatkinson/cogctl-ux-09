# User Story: User Story 3: Moving Object Velocity Telemetry (Issue #9)

## Domain Object Mapping
- **Primary Domain Objects:** `geo-location`, `velocity`, `v-north`, `v-east`, `v-up`, `timestamp`
- **Actor/Role:** Vehicle Tracking Receiver

## BDD Scenario (OOA/OOD Realization)
**Given** a moving object changing position
**When** the 3D velocity vector (v-north, v-east, v-up) and timestamp are recorded
**Then** the tracking receiver computes current speed and heading to predict the next position coordinates.

## Operational Context
> If the object is in motion, the velocity vector describes this motion at the time given by the timestamp. For a formula to convert these values to speed and heading, see RFC 9179.
