# User Story: User Story 6: Numeric Counters and Gauges (Issue #23)

## Domain Object Mapping
- **Primary Domain Objects:** `counter32`, `zero-based-counter32`, `counter64`, `zero-based-counter64`, `gauge32`, `gauge64`
- **Actor/Role:** System Telemetry Monitor

## BDD Scenario (OOA/OOD Realization)
**Given** the telemetry monitor is reading system state counters and gauges
**When** a new data sample is reported
**Then** the monitor verifies that the counter values have not decreased (unless reset) and that gauges lie within their defined bounds.

## Operational Context
> The counter and gauge types represent standard numeric instrumentation points. Counters monotonically increase and wrap around at maximum value, whereas gauges represent fluctuating levels bounded by zero and maximum value.
