# User Story: User Story 9: Time Durations (Issue #26)

## Domain Object Mapping
- **Primary Domain Objects:** `hours32`, `minutes32`, `seconds32`, `centiseconds32`, `milliseconds32`, `microseconds32`, `microseconds64`, `nanoseconds32`, `nanoseconds64`, `timeticks`, `timestamp`
- **Actor/Role:** Duration Calculator

## BDD Scenario (OOA/OOD Realization)
**Given** a time interval duration or event timetick is being calculated
**When** the duration value is entered or the timeticks wrap occurs
**Then** the calculator validates the bounds of the specific duration unit type and resets associated timestamp markers to 0 if a timeticks wrap happens.

## Operational Context
> Durations support time period representations ranging from hours down to nanoseconds. Timeticks track intervals modulo 2^32 in centiseconds, and associated timestamps mark specific epochs relative to timeticks.

## Required Features Matrix
