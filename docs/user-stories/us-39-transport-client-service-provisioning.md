# User Story 39: Transport Client Service Provisioning (Issue #115)

## Domain Object Mapping
- **Primary Domain Objects**: `client-svc`, `client-svc-instances`
- **Actor/Role**: Network Provisioning Engineer

## BDD Scenario (OOA/OOD Realization)

**As a** Network Provisioning Engineer  
**I need to** provision a transport client service instance between source and destination access ports  
**So that** high-bandwidth customer traffic is routed across the network over TE service tunnels.

### BDD Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** source and destination access ports are configured with compatible client signal types
- **When** the engineer provisions a client service instance mapped to active service tunnels
- **Then** the service provisioning state transitions to active and operational state transitions to up.

## Operational Context
> Transport client services are configured by mapping client signal access parameters to physical or logical Link Termination Points (LTPs) and associating them with traffic engineering tunnels.
