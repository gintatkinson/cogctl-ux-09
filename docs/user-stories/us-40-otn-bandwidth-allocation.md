# User Story 40: OTN Bandwidth Allocation (Issue #116)

## Domain Object Mapping
- **Primary Domain Objects**: `otn-topology`, `fgotn-bandwidth`, `fgts-range`
- **Actor/Role**: Network Design Architect

## BDD Scenario (OOA/OOD Realization)

**As a** Network Design Architect  
**I need to** allocate and partition fine-grain OTN tributary slot ranges and bandwidth parameters across a TE link  
**So that** low-rate client traffic can be dynamically routed through logical network topology slices with guaranteed QoS.

### BDD Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** a network TE link has a base OTN topology configuration and supports `fgODUflex`
- **When** the architect configures a fine-grain timeslot range with `fgts-reserved` and `fgts-unreserved` slots
- **Then** the system updates the unreserved fg-OTN bandwidth, and the validated topology is exposed to the path computation engine.

## Operational Context
> The data models defined in this document are designed to represent physical and logical network elements in an Optical Transport Network.
