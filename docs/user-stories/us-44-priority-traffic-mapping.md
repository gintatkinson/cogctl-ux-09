# User Story: User Story 44: Traffic Class Priority Mapping (Issue #144)

## Description
As a Network Operator,
I want to manage the Priority Regeneration and PCP Decoding/Encoding tables on bridge ports,
So that incoming priority code points (PCPs) map to the correct traffic class queues on transmission.

## BDD Acceptance Criteria

- **Scenario: Configure Custom PCP to Traffic Class mapping**
  - **Given** a bridge port's PCP decoding table is set to defaults
  - **When** the operator maps PCP 6 and 7 to traffic class 5
  - **Then** frames received with PCP 6 or 7 are successfully queued in traffic class queue 5.
