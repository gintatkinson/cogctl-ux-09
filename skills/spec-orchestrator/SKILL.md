# Autonomous Specification Orchestrator (Master Command)

This skill enables you to act as the **Master Orchestrator Agent**. You are responsible for executing an end-to-end "Digital Engineering Pipeline" that fully reverse-engineers a protocol standard (e.g., IETF, 3GPP, IEEE, CAMARA) into a deterministic GitHub repository matrix using UML OOA/OOD methodologies.

You will accomplish this by coordinating the sequential execution of three specialized Worker skills.

## Pre-Flight Checklist
Before beginning orchestration, verify you have:
1. The target specification identifier (e.g., RFC 8345, 3GPP TS 23.501).
2. The path(s) to the associated structural schemas (e.g., `*.yang`, `*.yaml`, `*.proto`).

## Phase 1: Structural Extraction (Worker A)
1. **Trigger**: Initialize the execution of the `schema-specification-engineering` skill.
2. **Context**: Pass the path to the target structural schema files.
3. **Execution**: Allow the worker logic to computationally extract EVERY structural element in the schema without abbreviation.
4. **Validation Gate**: You MUST wait for the Phase 1 execution to fully complete. The agent must successfully create all Feature issues FIRST, capture their IDs, inject them into the Epic markdown, and then create the Epic issue. Query GitHub (`gh issue list --state "open"`) to verify the new Epics and Features exist and are properly interlinked. Do not proceed to Phase 2 until the structural foundation is verified.

## Phase 2: Behavioral Extraction - User Stories (Worker B)
1. **Trigger**: Initialize the execution of the `spec-user-story-engineering` skill.
2. **Context**: Pass the text/path of the target specification document.
3. **Execution**: Allow the worker logic to parse the operational scenarios, extract the OOA/OOD User Stories, and query the GitHub repository to build the Cross-Cutting Matrix linking to the Phase 1 features.
4. **Validation Gate**: Verify that the `user-story` issues have been created in GitHub and that their tasklists successfully render the intersecting `#IssueID`s generated during Phase 1.

## Phase 3: System Interaction Extraction - UML Use Cases (Worker C)
1. **Trigger**: Initialize the execution of the `spec-usecase-engineering` skill.
2. **Context**: Pass the text/path of the target specification document.
3. **Execution**: Allow the worker logic to extract formal UML System Use Cases (Actors, Preconditions, Flow, Postconditions) and map them down to the User Stories from Phase 2 and Features from Phase 1.
4. **Validation Gate**: Verify that the `use-case` issues have been created in GitHub and that the Realization Matrix successfully links back to User Stories and Features.

## Phase 4: Reconciliation & Automated Verification (Worker D & Coverage Check)
1. **Trigger Backlog Reconciliation**: Run the automated backlog reconciliation script:
   ```bash
   ./skills/spec-orchestrator/reconcile_backlog.py
   ```
2. **Trigger Model Coverage Verification**: Run the automated model coverage parity check tool:
   ```bash
   ./skills/spec-orchestrator/verify_model_coverage.py
   ```
3. **Execution**: The backlog script queries GitHub issues, resolves checklist checkboxes in the local files, and automatically closes completed Epics, User Stories, and Use Cases. The coverage script verifies that every single node/typedef from the raw YANG schemas is exhaustively documented in the feature specs.
4. **Validation Gate**: Both scripts must execute successfully with exit code 0. Ensure that all completed tasks have been correctly updated/synced to GitHub, and that the overall model coverage is verified at exactly 100%.

## Phase 5: Final Reporting
1. Summarize the end-to-end pipeline execution for the user.
2. Provide direct links to the generated Epics, Features, User Stories, and Use Case tracking matrices.
3. Declare the protocol module "Fully Instrumentally Reverse-Engineered and Verified."
