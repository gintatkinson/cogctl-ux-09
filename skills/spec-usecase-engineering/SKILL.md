# Specification Use Case Engineering (System Interaction)

This skill enables a sub-agent to autonomously read a normative specification document and extract its high-level deployment patterns into formal, UML OOA/OOD compliant System Use Cases (e.g., Alistair Cockburn style). These Use Cases represent overarching system behavior and state transitions, and they map down to the granular User Stories and Features.

## Execution Trigger
You should invoke this skill ONLY after the behavioral User Stories have been extracted using the `spec-user-story-engineering` skill.

## Step 1: Context Ingestion
1. Ingest the target normative specification document.
2. Target the broad architectural and operational chapters (e.g., "Deployment Scenarios", "System Architecture", "Operational Considerations").
3. Identify the major functional groupings of behavior that define end-to-end system interactions.

## Step 2: UML OOA/OOD Use Case Modeling
For each major system interaction, model a formal Use Case following standard UML Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOA/OOD) formats:
1. **Primary & Secondary Actors:** The internal/external entities interacting with the system.
2. **Preconditions:** The exact state the system/objects must be in before the Use Case begins.
3. **Trigger:** The specific event or message that initiates the Use Case.
4. **Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow):** The sequential, step-by-step object interactions that lead to a successful outcome.
5. **Alternate/Exception Flows:** Variations in state, error conditions, or alternative paths.
6. **Postconditions (Success/Failure Guarantee):** The final guaranteed state of the system/objects.

## Step 3: The Realization Matrix (User Story/Feature Linking)
A System Use Case is realized by User Stories and structural Features.
1. Execute `gh issue list --label "user-story" --state "open" --json number,title` and `gh issue list --label "feature" --state "open" --json number,title` to pull the existing inventory.
2. Determine which User Stories and Features are required to fulfill this specific System Use Case.
3. Construct a `## Realization Matrix` containing a markdown tasklist of these intersecting links referencing BOTH the Issue ID and the absolute GitHub URL of the feature/user-story documents (relative links like `../features/...` resolve incorrectly on GitHub issues and cause 404 errors). You MUST dynamically determine the remote repository URL by running `git remote get-url origin` and construct the absolute link pointing to the file on the current branch (e.g., `- [ ] #41 - [Feature 01 Title](https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/branch_name/docs/features/feat-01.md)`).

## Step 4: Markdown Generation
Create a new file in `docs/use-cases/uc-[XX]-[name].md` (using a two-digit zero-padded index, e.g., `uc-01-provision-location.md`). Format strictly:

```markdown
---
title: "Use Case [X]: [Use Case Title] (Issue #[IssueID])"
type: "use-case"
issue: [IssueID]
spec_source: "[Spec Reference]"
---

# Use Case [X]: [Use Case Title] (Issue #[IssueID])

## 1. Actors
- **Primary Actor:** [Actor Name]
- **Secondary Actors:** [Actor Names]

## 2. Preconditions
- [Object/System State Precondition 1]
- [Object/System State Precondition 2]

## 3. Trigger
[The event or message that initiates the Use Case]

## 4. Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)
1. [Actor] does [Action]
2. [System/Object] responds by [Action/State Change]
3. [Step 3...]

## 5. Alternate and Exception Flows
- **5a. [Condition]:**
  1. [System/Object] does [Action]
- **5b. [Exception]:**
  1. [System/Object] aborts and returns to [State]

## 6. Postconditions (Guarantees)
- **Success Guarantee:** [Final Object/System State on success]
- **Failure Guarantee:** [Final Object/System State on failure/abort]

## 7. Operational Context
[Verbatim deployment scenarios quoted from the specification]

## 8. Realization Matrix
### Required User Stories
- [ ] #[IssueID] - [User Story Title](https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/branch_name/docs/user-stories/us-01.md)
### Required Features
- [ ] #[IssueID] - [Feature Title](https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/branch_name/docs/features/feat-01.md)

## Step 5: Zero-Fault GitHub Synchronization
1. Commit and push the Markdown files to the remote repository.
2. You MUST verify the `use-case` and `<protocol-name>` labels exist in the repository. Run `gh label create "use-case" --force` and `gh label create "<protocol-name>" --force`. Do not bypass this.
3. Create the issue natively in GitHub. You MUST explicitly bind the label:
   `gh issue create --title "[Use Case Title]" --body-file [path/to/markdown.md] --label "use-case"`
4. Verify the creation and return the generated GitHub URLs to the Orchestrator or User.
