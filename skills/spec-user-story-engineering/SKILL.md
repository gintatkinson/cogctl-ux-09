# Specification User Story Engineering (Behavioral Extraction)

This skill enables a sub-agent to autonomously read a normative specification document (e.g., IETF RFC, 3GPP TS, CAMARA API Doc) and extract its behavioral deployment scenarios into pure Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) User Stories modeled according to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOA/OOD) principles, linking them dynamically to structural features already defined in the GitHub repository.

## Execution Trigger
You should invoke this skill ONLY after the structural Features have been extracted using the `schema-specification-engineering` skill.

## Step 1: Context Ingestion (Operational Text)
1. Ingest the target normative specification document.
2. **IGNORE** the structural schemas (e.g., YANG, OpenAPI, Protobuf) and normative schema definitions.
3. Target and analyze the following operational chapters:
   - **Introduction & Applicability**
   - **Deployment Scenarios**
   - **Operational Considerations**
   - **Security Considerations**

## Step 2: Behavioral Modeling (OOA/OOD User Story Extraction)
For every distinct deployment scenario found, model it as a formal User Story integrated with OOA/OOD principles.
1. Identify the Actor/Role (the object or entity initiating the action).
2. Formulate the core scenario using strict BDD syntax mapped to object interactions:
   - `Given` (Precondition object state)
   - `When` (Triggering message or event)
   - `Then` (Postcondition object state)
   - Or standard format: `As an [Actor], I need to [Action/Message] so that [Outcome/State Change].`
3. Map the story to specific Domain Objects (the structural schema entities affected).

## Step 3: The Cross-Cutting Matrix (Feature Linking)
A User Story requires technical building blocks (Domain Objects/Features) to function. You must find the blocks that have already been built.
1. Execute `gh issue list --label "feature" --state "open" --json number,title` to pull the existing structural inventory.
2. Analyze the titles/scopes of those issues.
3. Determine exactly which of those `#IssueID`s are prerequisites for your extracted User Story.
4. Construct a `## Required Features` matrix in your document containing a markdown tasklist of these intersecting links referencing BOTH the Issue ID and the absolute GitHub URL of the feature document (relative links like `../features/...` resolve incorrectly on GitHub issues and cause 404 errors). You MUST dynamically determine the remote repository URL by running `git remote get-url origin` and construct the absolute link pointing to the file on the current branch (e.g., `- [ ] #41 - [Feature 01 Title](https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/branch_name/docs/features/feat-01.md)`).

## Step 4: Markdown Generation
Create a new file in `docs/user-stories/us-[XX]-[name].md` (using a two-digit zero-padded index, e.g., `us-01-w3c-mapping.md`). Format strictly:

```markdown
---
title: "User Story [X]: [User Story Title] (Issue #[IssueID])"
type: "user-story"
issue: [IssueID]
spec_source: "[Spec Reference]"
---

# User Story [X]: [User Story Title] (Issue #[IssueID])

## Domain Object Mapping
- **Primary Domain Objects:** [List affected structural schema entities]
- **Actor/Role:** [The object/entity initiating the action]

## BDD Scenario (OOA/OOD Realization)
**Given** [Initial system/object state]
**When** [Triggering action/event/message]
**Then** [Resulting system/object state]

*(Alternatively)*
**As an** [Actor]
**I need to** [Action]
**So that** [Outcome/State Change]

## Operational Context
[Verbatim operational constraints or deployment scenarios quoted from the specification]

## Required Features Matrix
- [ ] #[IssueID] - [Feature Title](https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/branch_name/docs/features/feat-01.md)

## Source References
YANG Schema: [Link to structural schema, e.g., ietf-geo-location@2022-02-11.yang](https://github.com/YangModels/yang/blob/main/standard/ietf/RFC/ietf-geo-location%402022-02-11.yang)
Normative Specification: [Link to normative specification, e.g., RFC 9179 Geographic Location](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9179/)
```

## Step 5: Zero-Fault GitHub Synchronization
1. Commit and push the Markdown files to the remote repository.
2. You MUST verify the `user-story` and `<protocol-name>` labels exist in the repository. Run `gh label create "user-story" --force` and `gh label create "<protocol-name>" --force`. Do not bypass this.
3. Create the issue natively in GitHub. You MUST explicitly bind the label:
   `gh issue create --title "[User Story Title]" --body-file [path/to/markdown.md] --label "user-story"`
4. Verify the creation and return the generated GitHub URLs to the Orchestrator or User.
